It is no longer about whether businesses should adopt AI, but how deeply AI should be integrated into the core fabric of operations. At Laneway, we’ve observed a critical transition — the move from simple automation to Strategic Augmentation.",

                        "The most significant shift this year is the evolution of AI from a passive tool into an active agent. Unlike traditional software that follows step-by-step instructions, modern AI agents understand high-level goals — such as optimizing supply chains or improving sustainability — and independently orchestrate workflows to achieve results.",

                        "AI transformation is not just a technological upgrade — it’s a cultural evolution. Organizations that succeed in 2026 will build teams capable of collaborating with AI as a strategic co-worker. The true winners will not be the companies with the most AI, but those with the strongest Human-AI Synergy.",
